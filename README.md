# Gemini API examples

This repo contains sample code for key features of the Gemini API. The repo is
organized by programming language.

These samples are embedded in parts of the
[documentation](https://ai.google.dev), most notably in the
[API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api).

Each file is structured as a runnable test case, ensuring that samples are
executable and functional. Each test demonstrates a single concept, and contains
region tags that are used to demarcate the test scaffolding from the spotlight
code. If you are contributing, code within region tags should follow sample code
best practices - being clear, complete and concise.
